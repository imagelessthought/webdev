<div class="noticea">
<p>Please read the information below carefully, the terms and conditions of the agreement, before purchasing.</p>
</div>
<p>UNT offers heavily discounted Adobe Creative Cloud subscriptions to <em>currently enrolled students</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each subscription is valid for the entire <em>academic year</em>, August 21st 2023-August 31st, 2024.</li>
<li>All subscriptions will expire on August 31st, 2024 - </b><b><u>regardless of the date of purchase.</u></b></li>
<li><b>There is not a prorated price</b>, the price is $50 plus a $3 processing fee year round.</li>
<li>Students that continue their enrollment at UNT beyond the current academic year will have the option to renew their subscription before the expiration date.</li>
<li>These subscriptions allow students to use the <b>Adobe Creative Cloud</b> applications on any device: personally owned computers (home desktop or laptop), university desktop computers (labs and classrooms), laptops (university checkout) and the UNT Online Lab computers.</li>
<li>Students without a subscription may access <em>some</em> of the Adobe Creative Cloud applications while using a computer in one of the on-premise classrooms or labs at no cost: cloud features and many applications are not available.</li>
<li>It may take up to two business days for your Adobe Creative Cloud subscription to be activated. If after two days, you are not able to login: please contact us at <a href="mailto:adobe@unt.edu?subject=WEBFORM: Adobe Help" alt="Email UNT Adobe Administrator">adobe@unt.edu</a>.</li>
<li>This is an educational subscription. To maintain your access to the software and services provided by the subscription you must remain actively enrolled as a student at the institution. The subscription will expire on August 31st unless your status as a student at UNT changes before this date. If your status as an active student changes your subscription will be terminated at that time. If you purchase a subscription during the Fall semester and do not enroll in at least one course at UNT during the Spring semester your subscription will be terminated on or after the 12th class day of the semester. If you withdraw from UNT at any point prior to August 31st, your subscription will be terminated at that time. If you remain enrolled at UNT through the Spring semester, regardless of whether you enroll in summer courses, your subscription will remain active until August 31st. We are not able to offer prorated prices or refunds.
</li>
<li>
If you already have an active subscription to the Adobe Creative Cloud, purchased through Adobe or another seller, but would like to take advantage of this offer: Adobe will allow you to opt-out of your existing agreement without incurring an early termination fee <em>once you have purchased a subscription through this offer</em>. You must contact Adobe within 14 days of purchase to opt-out without penalty. <b>Adobe Customer Care can be reached by phone at 1-800-833-6687, you may also visit their <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/contact.html" alt="Adobe Support Website">support website</a> and talk to someone via chat.</b>
</li>
<li>
If you need to <b>request a refund for any reason, you have 14 days from the date of purchase to make the request</b>.  After 14 days the sale is final in most cases.
</li>
<li>
When you graduate or leave UNT you may offboard your account to Adobe. After offboarding, your files will be transferred to a <b>free</b> Adobe-hosted personal account. Personal accounts are not eligible for any UNT-negotiated discounts so your subscription will end at that time. While the personal Adobe accounts are free, you must purchase a subscription to continue using the applications. If you are leaving UNT and are not ready to start a new subscription with Adobe right away, you can still offboard to preserve your files in the cloud. For more information, please see the Adobe website on <a href="https://graduation.adobe.com" alt="Adobe Support Site">Student Asset Migration</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are a student, with an existing personal subscription with Adobe and you used your UNT email address to sign up for that account: PLEASE change the email address associated with that account before you purchase a subscription through the UNT offer. You can do that by following these instructions: <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/sign/using/change-email-address.html" alt="Adobe Help: Change Email">AdobeHelpX: Changing Your Email Address</a>. <b>You cannot change the email address on the accounts\subsciptions available through our educational institution offer</b>. Adobe technical support has tremendous difficulty distinguishing between accounts with the same email address. It will greatly hinder you when you need help from our office or from Adobe if you have two accounts with the same email address.
