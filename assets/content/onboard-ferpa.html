The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
<p>School officials may disclose "directory" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance <b class="dgreenfont">unless the student has indicated that they do not want any of their directory information to be released or if the student is choosing in this specific case that they do not want their directory information shared and has opted out of this service or software</b>. This information is considered <b>open directory</b>. Each institution is able to determine what student information is considered open directory: the UNT FERPA policy contains the list of directory information for our institution: <a href="https://policy.unt.edu/sites/default/files/07.018%20FERPA.pdf" alt="UNT Policy 07.018 FERPA">UNT Policy 07.018 FERPA</a>.  The policy for many universities is to include a <b>student's university-assigned email address in open directory</b>, which allows for it to be shared by school officials (unless the student has requested that it be withheld) to external partners that provide services to our students (both those paid for by the university or college and those that are free or free for educational use). It is also common to include restrictions on the use of that information: example, that the information may only be used to provide services and not for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Students may visit the <b>UNT Registrar's</b> website <a href="https://registrar.unt.edu/transcripts-and-records/withhold-or-release-your-personal-information.html" alt="UNT Registrar">for information on withholding or releasing their personal information</a>.</p>
<p>Our sibling campuses in the UNT System: <a href="http://catalog.untdallas.edu/content.php?catoid=3&navoid=55" alt="UNT-Dallas Open Directory Information">UNT Dallas</a> and <a href="https://catalog.unthsc.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=1670" alt="UNT-HSC Open Directory Information">UNT Health Science Center</a> <b>both include university-assigned student email addresses in open directory information</b>.

<p><a href="https://dir.texas.gov/information-security/texas-risk-and-authorization-management-program-tx-ramp" alt="TXRAMP Website">TX-RAMP: [Texas Risk and Authorization Management Program]</a>: The Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 475, requiring the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) to establish a state risk and authorization management program that provides <b>“a standardized approach for security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring of cloud computing services that process the data of a state agency.”</b>  To comply, DIR established a framework for collecting information about cloud services security posture and assessing responses for compliance with required controls and documentation: TX-RAMP. Texas Government Code 2054.0593 mandates that state agencies as defined by Texas Government Code 2054.003(13) must only enter or renew contracts to receive cloud computing services that comply with TX-RAMP requirements beginning January 1, 2022. TX-RAMP requirements apply to institutions of higher education, and public community colleges (Texas Government Code 2054.003 (13)).</p>
<p>
The TX-RAMP framework allows that technology resources may be considered out of scope of TX-RAMP with use of confidential information for the purpose of authentication, such as a student’s UNT email address. Services that are <em>low-impact SaaS (Software As A Service)</em> are also specifically identified as out-of-scope: these include services categorized as <b class="dgreenfont">graphic design\illustration</b>, <b class="dgreenfont">scheduling</b>, <b class="dgreenfont">email notification</b>, <b class="dgreenfont">social media</b> and <b class="dgreenfont">research (consumption-focused)</b>. You can take a look at the <a href="https://dir.texas.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/TX-RAMP%20Overview%20Webinar%20For%20Vendors.pdf" alt="TXDIR:TXRAMP">TX-RAMP Overview</a> from the <b>Texas Department of Information Resources</b> for more information. The information on out-of-scope services begins on Slide 11 of the overview.</p>

<h2 class="greenfont">Impact on Procurement of Online Services and Software with Cloud Integrations</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, at universities that have university-assigned student email addresses in open directory, school officials may share those email addresses with external partners to provide students with access to a cloud-based services (again - unless the student has opted  that they do not want any of their directory information to be released or if the student is choosing in this specific case that they do not want their directory information shared and has opted out of this service or software). They may also take advantage of the TX-RAMP out-of-scope exceptions, also mentioned above.</p>
<p><b>Because university-assigned student email addresses are not considered open directory at UNT-Denton, they must be protected under FERPA.</b></p>
<p>We may not enter into agreements with providers of cloud-based services (including software with cloud integration) for students that do not have TX-RAMP certification without a security assessment being performed by the university. Provisional certification may be sufficient.</p>

<h3 class="greenfont">What is Required for the Security Assessment?</h3>
<p>A TAQ has to be submitted by the CVAD IT Services department.  </p>
<p>
  •	The department must complete a Department Risk Survey.<br>
  •	The vendor must complete a Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit (HECVAT).<br>
  •	The vendor must also provide the following documentation:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery Plan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information Security Policies/Plan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOC (Service Organization Controls) Reports, if available<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-top:1rem">Additionally, the <a href="https://registrar.unt.edu/faculty/ferpa-and-student-records.html" alt="UNT Registrar">UNT Registrar</a> office must approve the request to share student email addresses with the vendor. </p>

<section id="questions">
<div class="section">
<h2 class="greenfont">Questions</h2>
<h3 class="greenfont" style="margin-top:.75rem">How long does the assessment take?</h3>
<p>If the software in question can be installed locally on a machine and there is not cloud-integration: compliance approval has always had a pretty fast turnaround: generally <em>less than 5 days</em>.  For cloud services and software with cloud integration we did experience some significant delays in the TAQ approval process in spring and summer. A lot of changes have occurred in our organization over the past several months and it affected the entire procurement process. But UNT System IT Compliance has made changes to improve the process and provide a quicker turnaround.</p>
<p>Going forward, we can expect all of the TAQ approvals to have a turnaround time of about 5 days <em>from the time the information required for the security assessment is provided to the university</em>. The time to receive the required information may vary: it can take less than an hour, or two weeks or more - it depends on the particular vendor. In some cases the vendor may require a signed non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to be in place before agreeing to provide the security assessment information to the university - that will certainly add time to the approval process as the NDA will need to go the UNT System Contracts office, which may require up to 30 days to review and sign the NDA.</p>
<p style="margin-top:1rem"><b>This all assumes that the vendor is willing to provide the requested security assessment information to the university in the first place, not all have.</b></p>
<p style="margin-top:1rem">You can find more information on the security assessment at UNT System IT Compliance website, <a href="https://itss.untsystem.edu/divisions/mrs/it-compliance/technology-risk-assessment-program.php" alt="TAQ Information">Technology Risk Assessment Program</a>.</p>
<h3 class="greenfont" style="margin-top:1.5rem">After the security assessment is completed - what else needs to happen before we can enter into an agreement?</h3>
<p>After the compliance approval is completed, the contract agreement must be reviewed and signed by the UNT System Contracts department: in theory this should be completed in 30 days but, at least currently due to the volume of requests, this is taking longer. <em>This contract review is separate from the NDA, if one were required.</em></p>
<p>After we have the contract agreement signed we are free to move forward with acquisition.  If it is a free offer for educational use - the process is complete. If payment is required - it will likely take between 1-2 weeks, depending on whether a REQ is required or we are able to use a pcard and whether the vendor is already in the University's vendor management system: <b>Payment Works</b>.</p>

<p><a href="https://community.paymentworks.com/payees/s/contactsupport" alt="PaymentWorks Support">Link to Contact PaymentWorks Support</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that there is still the technical implementation side. If we are required to tie-in to <b>Single-Sign-On</b> or <b>DUO for Multi-Factor Authentication</b> that will take time and it will depend on the availability of the <b>Directory Services</b> team, which also has a high volume of requests currently.</p>
<p style="margin-top:1rem"><b>There are still some things that need to be worked out regarding the procurement process so do not plan to acquire a new piece of software with cloud integration or online service to be used during the Fall semester. Submit your requests now for Spring so we can begin the process now.</b></p>
<h3 class="greenfont" style="margin-top:1.5rem">How can instructors use online services in their courses?*</h3>
<p>Unless the vendor completes the security assessment, it is approved by the UNT System IT Compliance office, or the vendor has certification through TX-RAMP: an instructor <b>may not make the use of an online the service a class requirement</b>, only an optional resource that the student <em>may</em> choose to use. If the student chooses not to use the service, it cannot affect their grade in the course. It must be the student's decision as to whether or not to create an account with the service and share their university-assigned email address or personal information (name, personal email address, address, etc.).</p>
<p>You may give your students information on any online services that are available, whether we have an agreement or not, and as long as it is not subject to policy or a requirement, it may be used as long as the student themself is responsible for creating their own account on the service. It would also be their responsibility to terminate their account if they chose to. UNT faculty and staff may not be involved in account creation or sharing university-assigned student email addresses or other protected information with an external party.</p>
<p>As long as the conditions above are met (basically that the student makes the decision to share their email address with the company by making an account and it is not required as part of the course): you may use any service available. I strongly recommend that you tell them to look at the company's privacy and information sharing policies before they signup for an account.</p>
<p class="greenfont">* This content was reviewed by UNT System IT Compliance and the UNT Registrar on 8/17/2023.</p>
<h3 class="greenfont" style="margin-top:1.5rem">What About Online Services That the College Has Purchased For Students?</h3>
<p>If the service requires an email address in order to create an account on the service, we may assign a license to a student only if they have voluntarily (again not due to a class requirement) created an account on the service using their university-assigned email address.  We cannot create accounts for students and cannot require they provide their personal information for mandatory participation.</p>
<h3 class="greenfont" style="margin-top:1.5rem">May they use a personal email account?</h3>
<p>If the service was purchased by the university or college they must use their university-assigned email address in order to receive a subscription.</p>
<p>If the service is not provided by the university or college, but is a publicly available service, they may use any email address they choose. But it must be their choice to do so and use of the service still may not be a course requirement and if the student does not choose to use the service, it cannot impact their grade in the course.</p>
<h3 class="greenfont" style="margin-top:1.5rem">What if I need help?</h3>
<p>Each case is different and must be reviewed in order to determine how we may proceed so it will need to be done on a case-by-case basis. Feel free to reach out and schedule a time with me.  I can also come to department meetings if the department chair requests.</p>
