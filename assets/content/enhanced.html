<p>The College of Visual Arts and Design recognizes that the research responsibilities of our faculty may require that enhanced privileges be granted to you on your personally assigned computer(s) and\or grant-funded equipment. We have an agreement with <b class="semi-bold">UNT Information Security</b> to provide this level of access to current full-time faculty. If you would like to request enhanced privileges be granted to you on your personally-assigned device, please use the link below to submit a request.</p>
<p>A few things to be aware of: </p>
<ul class="half">
<li>This option is only available to full-time Faculty. </li>
<li>You must maintain compliance with the UNT World Annual Information Security Training. </li>
<li>You must present your computer to CVAD IT Services at least once a year for a review. </li>
<li>You must have the approval of your Department Chair and the Dean. </li>
<li>The policy is subject to change at the discretion of the Dean or higher. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>Once you submit the form, which requires a digital signature, your Department Chair and the Dean will review the request and either approve or deny the request. You will receive an email notification once the request has been processed. If denied you should follow up with your Department Chair. </p>
<p>If approved, you will need to come by our office in the Art Building, Room 371, so the enhanced privileges can be granted. </p>
<p>To request enhanced privileges, please <a href="/request-enhanced/" alt="reqenhanced" id="reqenhanced">submit this form</a>.</p>
