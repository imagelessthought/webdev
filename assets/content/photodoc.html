  <p>The <b class="semi-bold">Photo Documentation Service</b> is open to CVAD students, faculty, and staff. Part of the function of the service is to create a database of student work that the university can pull from when creating promotional materials. Because of this, you will be required to sign a release to have your work photographed. </p>
  <p>To use the photo documentation room, you must schedule a 30-minute appointment. You can bring work of any kind, 2D or 3D. We will photograph no more than 5 pieces per appointment. If you have more pieces, feel free to schedule multiple appointments back-to-back. </p>
