<p>Prior to making any technology-related purchase you must submit the request to our office for approval so we are able to review the purchase for any issues that must be addressed, questions or concerns we have about potential support issues, and to ensure the request meets UNT World compliance and purchasing standards.</p>
<p>In all cases we will work to ensure the college is getting the best possible price: educational discounts may be available, as a state agency we are tax-exempt, and we may be able to find a better price for technology requested through a different vendor.</p>
<p>In some, but not all cases, we may be able fill a request with existing equipment. In the case of software requests, we may be able fill the request using another source of funds, saving a faculty member from having to spend startup or grant funds on the purchase. That will depend on the use case: please clearly identify the use case. </p>
<p>Once the review has been completed, we will provide a quote from a vendor to be used to make the purchase.</p>
<p>Requests can be submitted using our <a href="/request-tech/" alt="servicenow" id="servicenow">online form</a>.</p>

<h3>This policy applies to: </h3>
<li>Computers, printers, and other peripherals. </li>
<li>Software: Free and Open Source Software must be submitted for review as well as proprietary software.</li>

<p>Computers purchases must adhere to the UNT Computing Standards: exceptions to the base models are available when needed to meet software or other technology requirements. The UNT Computer Standards for instruction and research are <em>not</em> low specifications: they are chosen to meet the needs of a wide range of software and equipment. If you need an exception to the standard configuration, we will get a quote for a computer that meets the requirements of the software and\or hardware.</p>
<p>If requesting a computer: let us know which platform (Mac, PC), a description of the intended use, and the software and equipment you intend to use with the computer. Computer or hardware purchases must include a service agreement. </p>
<p>If requesting software or an online service, the request must pass a mandated compliance approval.  If applicable, a p-card purchase approval will also be requested.</p>
<p>For peripherals and accessories we will review to confirm compatibility.</p>
<p>Computer and general peripheral approvals generally have a quick turnaround except during periods of high activity such as during the first 12 class days of semester or the end of the semester. </p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Requests are rarely rejected</b>. Approvals for software and online services can take a week or more under normal circumstances. During periods of high activity, such as when the university is working on a large computer purchase, it may take longer. If you are requesting a software or online service that stores certain types of information <b class="semi-bold">(Category 1)</b> the review may be more extensive, and we may need to follow up with you and the vendor to get additional information for approval. </p>
