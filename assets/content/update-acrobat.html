  <h2>Adobe Acrobat</h2>
  <p>All CVAD computers come with Acrobat Reader preinstalled. If the full Acrobat Pro application is not installed on your computer and it is required (or if it has been removed and needs to be reinstalled), it can be installed through the <b>Adobe Creative Cloud</b> application.  The steps below will walk you through installing the app.</p>
  <p>If you have an out-of-date version of the Acrobat application with a <em>severe security vulnerability</em> installed on your device, it will be automatically removed from your device to mitigate the issue. When you follow the steps below, the latest version of the app will be installed.</p>
