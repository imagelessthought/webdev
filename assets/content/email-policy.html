<h1>Employees: Access to UNT Resources</h1>
</div>
</main>

<section id="untres1">
<div class="section">
<p>University employees receive access to various resources and equipment as part of their employment at UNT. These are paid for by UNT (or through a grant) and belong to the university, as do the materials and any information stored on them, once the individual leaves UNT. These resources and equipment are provided for your work as a UNT employee and are not for personal use.</p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Once an individual leaves UNT, they will no longer have access to these resources: this includes but is not limited to UNT email account(s) and the Adobe Creative Cloud subscription (and the files contained on the Adobe Cloud)</b>.</p>
<p>Any backups should be done prior to an employee's final day with the university. We also suggest departing employees put a permanent out-of-office reply on email accounts notifying people that they have left UNT and provide new contact information <em>prior to their final day</em>. Supervisors should ensure access to files and other resources needed by their department is not lost upon the employee's departure.</p>
<p>Adjuncts who do not teach courses in <em>both long semesters</em> (Fall and Spring) will only have access to these resources while they are actively employed by the college or university. In regard to their UNT Email: plan ahead by setting up an out-of-office reply if you are not returning for the next long semester.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>Some things to be aware of from the <b class="semi-bold">Office of Information Security and Compliance</b>: </p>
<ul>
<li>The accounts are owned by UNT and files that are associated are also owned by UNT. It is a policy violation to use university accounts for personal use, and to store university owned information in personal accounts.</li>
<li>Individuals that are not actively employed by the university are not entitled to use or have access to any content in a university account, system or resource. This applies across the board.</li>
<li>Information stored on a university resource is considered the property of the University. Once the separation date has been reached the employee is not authorized to access the information. </li>
</ul>
<p>Special consideration is given to retirees: this will be discussed during an employee's offboarding. </p>
