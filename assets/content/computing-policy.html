<h2 id="info">Responsibility to Secure the Space</h2>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Computer Lab</b> and <b class="semi-bold">Digital Fabrication Lab</b>: No patron will be allowed in the lab if not assigned to a workspace. No patron is allowed in the lab outside of posted lab hours. A valid UNT ID is required for admission.</p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">210 Specialized Classlabs</b>: These spaces are generally only accessible to faculty and students during active class periods <em>unless</em> an agreement is made with the department chair and program coordinator. Once a class has ended, the room must be vacated. If an instructor cancels a class, or class ends early, all students must vacate the space. <em>Instructors are responsible for securing the room after class ends</em>. Be sure all students have vacated and that all doors are closed securely before leaving. <b class="semi-bold">Please leave the space as you found it: please cleanup after yourself as a courtesy to other instructors and students.</b> If you find the room in an unacceptable state, please report it immediately to <a href="mailto:cvad.itservices@unt.edu?subject=WEBFORM: Computing Policy" alt="Email CVAD IT Services">our office</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding our <b class="semi-bold">Shared Computer Classlabs (ART 233, 313, and 338)</b>: once a class has ended or class ends early, the room must be vacated. These are <em>shared</em> spaces, so exceptions aren't possible as the space is scheduled for use by other instructors from multiple departments and programs.</p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Computer Lab</b> and <b class="semi-bold">Digital Fabrication Lab</b>: Patrons are required to inform the staff when they have finished with their workstation and are leaving the lab. If a patron leaves the lab without informing the staff, they will assume to have vacated their workstation after 15 minutes. The workstation may be restarted, and any unsaved work will be lost. </p> 
<h2>Changes in Hours of Operation</h2>
<p>The building will be closed during all observed University breaks, such as holidays or spring break. The building will also close for any emergency closures such as weather or health crisis. In short, if classes are canceled, the lab will similarly be closed.</p>
<p>Any exceptions to the normal operating hours due to holidays, short semesters, inclement weather, health emergencies, etc. will be posted in the CVAD Service Desk in Microsoft Teams and announced on the digital signage outside the lab. </p>
<p>No patrons are allowed in the <b class="semi-bold">Computer Lab</b>, <b class="semi-bold">Digital Fabrication Lab</b>, or any other supported area outside of our posted hours.</p>

<h2>Time Limits & Waitlists</h2>
<p>All workstations have established time limits to ensure that all patrons can get access to the resources that they require for their academic pursuits. In the <b class="semi-bold">Computer Lab</b>, standard workstations have a 2-hour time limit and specialty workstations have a one-hour time limit. Time limits are only enforced in the event of a waitlist. Lab attendants will inform patrons when there is a waitlist and warn those close to their time limit that they will need to surrender their workstation to waiting patrons. The staff will do their best to give ten-minute warnings when a patron’s time is almost up. Students will always have priority over non-student patrons. </p>

Depending on enrollment, students have access to different print resources. Only materials to be used in pursuit of academic credit may be produced in the Computer Lab.</p>
<p>Students currently enrolled in at least one course in the college, regardless of their major, have access to color laser printing, photo printing, and large format printing. All other UNT students have access to basic black and white laser printing and 3D printing.</p>
<p>Only materials to be used in pursuit of academic credit may be produced in the Computer Lab. Printing is limited to one final output, though progressive iterations are acceptable. Duplicate copies are not allowed in the lab. These limitations apply to both paper and 3D prints.</p>
<p>No outside paper may be used in the laser printers. Patrons may provide their own paper, or use the paper provided, for the large format printers. Patrons may use the filament provided, or an approved outside filament for the 3D printers: all outside filaments must be approved by the staff prior to use.</p>
