<h2>MacOS Ventura Update</h2>
<p>The MacOS Upgrade to the latest operating system, Ventura that was mentioned in the recent email is now available in <b>Self Service</b>.  We will not be sending <b>Nudge</b> notifications until next week but you are free to install it now if you like, and you won't see those notices at all.  Our goal is to get everyone upgraded to the new operating system by May 23rd. If you do not install it before then it will auomatically install on that day.  If you are planning to travel this summer, you will want to install it before you leave just in case there are any issues. We do not, however, anticipate any issues.  To make the upgrade go as smoothly as possible, we reccommend you not wait until the OS forces the upgrade on the 23rd. Here are some suggestions that will help ensure the upgrade completes in the shortest time possible.</p>
<ul class="whitebg">
<li>Connect your computer to the wired network.  Our tests indicate that it takes an hour or less if the device is on the wired network.</li>
<li>If you are going to be upgrading while on wi-fi, do so from on-campus if possible.</li>
</ul> 
<p>There is a <a href="#post-upgrade" alt="Rapid Security Responses">post-upgrade step</a> this time around.</p> 
<p>You can skip to the instructions on <a href="#self-service" alt="How to Launch the Upgrade in Self Service">How to Launch the Upgrade in Self Service</a> to begin the installation.  The steps for the <b>post-upgrade installation</b> are included immediately below this section.</p>
<p>As always if you would like to bring your computer into our office, or visit our online service desk, we will perform the upgrades for you.</h3>
<h3>Thank you for helping us keep you computer up to date and secure!</h3>

<h2>Nudge Notifications for Mandatory Updates</h2>
<p>When mandatory updates become available for your MacOS device, we use a notification system known as <b>Nudge</b> to alert our users that they are required to install these updates. These are official notifications and the updates need to be installed as soon as you are able to do so.  A period of time will be specified in the notice indicating how long you will have to install the updates, after which the updates will be installed automatically.  The device will be unavailable for you to use during the update so to avoid any inconveniences, please apply the updates when most convenient to you and before the time has expired. An email will be sent to your official UNT email address notifying you that a required update is available and that you will be receiving a notification." </p>
<p>Depending on the severity of the issue that the update addresses, the time before the update is automatically installed could be between 2 days and 2 weeks.</p>
<p>You can choose to install the update directly from the notification by clicking the <b>Update Device</b> button in the top right of the notification.</p>
<p>You can choose to defer the update and install it later, at a more convenient time by clicking the <b>defer</b> button at the bottom right. If you choose to defer, you will need to follow the instructions for <em>Self Service</em>, which are provided in the next section.</p>
<p>The device must be plugged in to an external power source and be connected to the internet for the update to be installed.  </p>
<p>If the device is not able to install the update (not connected to power, not connected to the internet or there is not enough drive space for the update) your device will not allow you to use it until it is <em>physically</em> brought into our office, it will not be possible to install the update remotely.</p>
<ul><li>Be aware, upgrading the computer can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on network speed and/or age of computer. Please be prepared to allot adequate time to the process. </li>
<li>Be sure to save all open files and close all applications prior to starting the update process. </li></ul>

Fortunately, is a very quick installation. You will see an announcement like the one below after you install the MacOS Ventura Upgrade.  You are able to install it by clicking on the announcement by clicking on it the announcement and following the instructions.  If you dismiss the announcement or need to confirm that it is installed, simply open up <b>System Preferences > General > Software Update</b> and <b>Check for Updates</b> if you do not see it available as an option. Run the Check for Updates just to be certain.</p> 
<p>You will be prompted for a login, but this is not a request for administrator credentials, you can use your own EUID and password to install the update.</p>
