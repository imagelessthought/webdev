<p>This tutorial provides information on using the audio-visual system available in <b>College of Visual Arts and Design</b> learning spaces and conference rooms. The information below applies to almost all of the rooms in the <b>Art Building</b> and <b>Art Building Annex</b>.  The exceptions are ART 219, 223 and 226: these are general use classrooms (the official designation is ''110 Classrooms'') used by our instructors as well as instructors teaching courses provided by other colleges. All other spaces, including the forty-three (43) specialized classrooms (the official designation is ''210 Class Labs'') use the audio-visual systems described in this tutorial. The differences in the audio visual systems reflect the different needs to effectively support Arts and Design curriculum and support is provided by the local IT department: <a role="link" href="https://itservices.cvad.unt.edu" alt="cvad its">College of Visual Arts and Design, Information Technology Services</a>.</p>
<p>About half of the scheduled learning spaces at the University of North Texas are general use classrooms. General use classrooms are discipline-independent and are equipped with a standardized audio-visual solution, creating a consistent experience across these spaces for instructors but without any specialized, discipline-specific software, hardware, or other equipment. General use classrooms are centrally managed by the campus <a role="link" href="https://classroomsupport.unt.edu/" alt="DSI">DSI: Digital Strategy and Innovation</a>. Where possible, we align our solutions with those used in the general use classrooms found on campus and <em>unnecessary</em> deviations are avoided. Because of the nature of art and design curriculum, it is <em>necessary</em> to provide solutions that deviate from those standards in many cases. An example is both Mac and Windows computers are provided at the lectern station in our learning spaces and conference rooms, whereas the general use classrooms provide Windows computers exclusively.</p>
<p>The <a role="link" href="https://academictechnologies.unt.edu/governance/lifecycle-management-groups-lmgs/labclassroom-lmg" alt="Academic Technologies Classlab LMG">Class Laboratory Lifecycle Management Group Homepage</a>, part of the <a role="link" href="https://academictechnologies.unt.edu/" alt="Academic Technologies Homepage">Academic Technologies Governance Committee</a>, is responsible for maintaining the alignment with standards.</p>

<p>The desktop shortcuts above are available on the lectern desktops in each classroom.</p>
<h3 style="color:red" aria-hidden="true">In case of an emergency, the appropriate action is to Call 911 <em>immediately</em>.</h2>
<p>The <a role="link" href="/support/" alt="Request Classroom Support">Request Support</a> shortcut can be used to notify the CVAD Service Desk when there is an issue that needs to be addressed in the classroom. If there is an issue with the lectern computer or audio-visual equipment, use this shortcut to request support by reporting the issue and a technician will come to your classroom <em>right away</em>. The shortcut goes to our classroom support form: instructors can report issues and request support or make a general request such as requesting a software application.</p>
<p>We have been asked by instructors in the past how they should report an emergency in a classroom, so we thought it best to add a link that made that clear to not delay a response. The <a role="link" href="/emergency/" alt="Emergency Response Information">Emergency Response Information</a> shortcut tells the instructor to call 911 in case of an emergency and provides some useful links found on the <a role="link" href="https://police.unt.edu/" alt="UNT Police Department website">UNT Police Department</a> and <a role="link" href="https://riskmanagement.unt.edu/" alt="UNT Risk Management">UNT Risk Management</a> websites.</p>

<p>The touchpanel is used to control the audio visual set-up: choose between a Mac or Windows computer, turn on/off the projector, turn on wireless streaming to the projector, and control the room camera, speaker volume, and microphones.</p>
<div class="flex-container">

  </div>
</div>
<p>The Extron TLP Pro 725T is a 7” Tabletop TouchLink® Pro touchpanel with many enhanced features. Inside there's a powerful new quad-core processor and eight times more memory feeding the seven inch, high resolution capacitive touchscreen. The enhanced touchscreen delivers stunning graphics and superb durability with scratch and smudge resistant Corning® Gorilla Glass®. Outside you'll find a stylish, ergonomic enclosure that will complement any contemporary presentation environment.</p>
<p>The TLP Pro 725T was designed for today, but with an eye on the future. With its improved graphics engine, quad-core processor, and increased RAM, you’ll see faster background graphic loads and crisper page flips. These performance enhancements offer an enhanced user experience now, while providing ample memory and processing power to support exciting new features and capabilities in the future via firmware upgrades.</p>
<h2 class=>Touchpanel Layout and Options: CVAD Academic Spaces</h2>
<p>When you arrive in the classroom, the touch panel will most likely be asleep: it is programmed to shutdown to conserve power when not in use (it also increases the life of the device). It takes around 15 seconds to wake: this is to allow the projector time to warm up.</p>
<p>Below is an image of the touchpanel configuration that is used in our classrooms, along with a description of how to use each feature on the touch panel.</p>

  <figcaption>This an image of the controls screen on the Touch Panel found in each classroom</figcaption>
  </div>
 </div>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Display </b> (ON/OFF/Video Mute): The ON/OFF buttons control the power to the projector. Video Mute will blank the display without turning off the projector.</p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Volume </b> (MUTE): This is the master volume control; the slide bar sets the volume of all devices across the board and the MUTE button silences all audio output from the audio visual system.</p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Audio Controls</b>: This opens the advanced audio control panel, where you can set the volume of the microphone independently of the other devices.</p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Camera Controls</b>: This opens the control panel for the room camera (mounted in the ceiling). You can turn the camera (360 degrees) and zoom (12x). When you find a camera position that you want to be able to return to, hold down one of the <b class="semi-bold">preset</b> buttons and the touch panel will store the setting. To have the camera return to that position just press the preset button again without holding it down. The control panel does not show the camera feed, to see what the camera is displaying you will need to use one of the <a role="link" href="#avsoftware"alt="Software">camera software applications</a> installed on the lectern computer.</p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Help</b>: This will provide you with our phone number, in case you need to call us: you can use this to reach us for support if there is an issue with the lectern computers and\or you are not able to reach our support request form.</p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Mac</b>: This button switches the input to the Mac computer installed in the lectern. The monitor, projector, and all AV equipment will receive their input from the Mac computer. </p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Windows</b>: This button switches the input to the Windows computer installed in the lectern. The monitor, projector, and all AV equipment will receive their input from the Windows computer. </p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">Screen share</b>:This button switches the projector input to the Airtame 2 that is installed in the room to provide screen sharing. The projector and all AV equipment will receive their input from the Airtame 2 but the monitor will still display the last input. Example: if the instructor is using the Mac computer in the lectern, when they switch the "Screen share" the projector will show the Airtame 2 and allow people to connect wirelessly and all output from the audio-visual system will come from the streamed device, but the monitor will continue to display the lectern computer so the instructor will still be able to use it while screen sharing is active.</p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">HDMI</b>: If the lectern has an HDMI jack available in the "cable caddy" near the front of the lectern (also contains power outlets) you can plug a device in and press the HDMI button to change the audio visual input to that device. This should only be used by devices that cannot stream wirelessly through the Airtame 2.</p>
<p><b class="semi-bold">DOC CAM</b>: This option is only available in rooms with a WolfVision Visualizer. When you select DOC CAM, the WolfVision Visualizer provides the input directly to the audio-visual system. With the IPEVO,and this is an option with the WolfVision as well, you are able to display the content from the Document Camera using the one of the <a role="link" href="#avsoftware" alt="Software">camera software applications</a> installed on the lectern computer.</p>

<p>Each classroom is equipped with an Airtame 2 wireless streaming device. Wireless screen sharing makes it easy to engage the room, whether you’re teaching a class, or collaborating with colleagues. Cast from your personal device to the shared screen. The Airtame 2 allows streaming from virtually any laptop or mobile device: Mac, Windows, Android.</p>
<p>If you are using a CVAD-provided laptop, you can install the Airtame app from <b class="semi-bold">Self Service</b> if you are using a Mac and from <b class="semi-bold">Software Center</b> if you are using a Windows laptop. Students can download the applications from the <a role="link" href="https://airtame.com/download/" alt="Download Airtame App">Airtame  website</a>. No app is needed to connect from mobile devices (you can connect directly with Airplay, Google Cast or Miracast) and on a Mac laptop, though the app offers additional functionality, you can connect as you would to an Apple TV using Airplay. For Windows users, the Airtame website has a portable app available for download so that no install is needed: look for <em>Windows (no admin rights)</em> in the download section.</p>
<p>We have around 50 Airtames in use in the building. When you attempt to screen share from a device, you will be presented with a list of Airtames to choose from: the information in the bottom left of the screen will help you identify which one to select. Once you select the Airtame you want to stream to, you will be prompted for a pin code: the pin code will be displayed on the projector. Once you type in the pin code your device will begin streaming to the projector.</p>
<p>If the app is asking you for a pin code but it is not being shown on the projector: you are likely trying to connect to the wrong Airtame.</p>
<p>In the bottom left of the screen, in addition the room number, the IP address of the Airtame is also displayed: you can use this to connect as well if you are using one of the Airtame apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share from any device with Miracast, AirPlay, GoogleCast, or from the Airtame App.</li>
<li>Share what you want, with full screen mirroring or just a single window; even cast to multiple screens.</li>
<li>Share it securely, with PIN code connect.</li>

<h2 class="bigh2 greenfont">Software for Cameras</h2>
<h2 class=>Default Software</h2>
<p>For some instructors it may be rare that the cameras are used for anything more than video-conferencing: <a role="link" href="https://unt.zoom.us/" alt="UNT Zoom portal">Zoom</a> or <a role="link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/log-in">Microsoft Teams</a>. However, there are software applications installed on each of the lectern computers that will provide some additional functionality if required.</p>
<p>Both the Mac and Windows operating systems provide default apps that will allow you to do some simple tasks. You can use these to: view what each camera is currently showing (you may want to do this before beginning a video-chat so you can reposition the room camera or other cameras), take pictures, or troubleshoot any issues you are having with your camera feeds. The applications shown below are the default camera applications for each operating system:</p>

Both are cross-platform, open-source software solutions that have a devoted following online. OBS Studio is the more sophisticated and well documented of the two, and is a popular application with users who <em>live stream.</em> Webcamoid is a fairly intuitive application that receives positive reviews on multiple camera management.</p>
