<div class="section">
<p>If you have an on-campus event planned, in one of our buildings or elsewhere on campus, we can provide event planning and support for the event.  We need as much lead time as possible during a long semester, and during the summer semesters keep in mind that we will be working around planned student orientations in our <b class="semi-bold">Computer Lab</b> and in some of our classrooms, as well technology upgrades planned for these spaces.  Contact us early so we can make sure the space(s) you require will be available.</p>
<p>If you are hosting an event off-campus, please contact the <a href="mailto:cvad.itservices@unt.edu?subject=WEBFORM: Event Planning" alt="Email CVAD IT Services">CVAD Service Desk</a> to inquire about available services.</p>
<h3 id="page-content">Services Provided</h3>
<ul class="half">
<li>Room Reservations</li>
<li>Webinar Support: Zoom and Microsoft Teams</li>
<li>Technical Support</li>
<li>Event Planning: Technology Needs</li>
<li>Technology Equipment Checkout</li>
<li>Materials Preparation</li>
</ul>
<p class="semi-bold section-text"><b>*</b> Additional services are available.  Once we meet and discuss your needs, we will work to ensure all your needs are addressed.</p> 
<h3 id="page-content2">Slideshows</h3>
<p>One of the most common requests we receive for exhibitions and events is for slideshows to display images of student work or informational slides. You can find information on the service we provide for slideshows <a href="/slideshows/" alt="How to Make A Slideshow" id="slideshow">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="servicedescription">Service Details and Notes</h3>
<p>If your event falls outside of the normal operating hours of our department, we can make someone available to provide technology support during your event <em>if we have enough lead time to schedule someone</em>.</p>
<p>We can provide laptops, projectors, cameras, and other devices you may require.</p>
<p>This can include helping prepare Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote presentations, or providing printed materials for the event. If you will be requesting printed materials, please ensure we have enough lead time: the printers we will use to print your materials are the same printers used by students to complete their course work and students are always given first priority on the equipment during the semester. During a semester there are high utilization times that may impact our ability to have your materials ready for your event. </p>
<p class="section-text semi-bold">Please do not ask a student to print your event materials in the Computer Lab: this prevents a student from working on their class assignment(s) and the printing counts against their <em>personal</em> print quota for the semester. You may contact the <a href="mailto:cvad.itservices@unt.edu?subject=WEBFORM: Event Planning" alt="Email CVAD IT Services">CVAD Service Desk</a> to inquire about printing. Events must be approved by the <b class="semi-bold">College of Visual Arts and Design</b> Leadership as there may be costs associated with the printing.</p>
