  <h1>Updating your Windows Device</h1>
  <p>This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for installing updates on your Windows device. </p>

<p>It is important to keep your device up to date to ensure there are no security vulnerabilities present on your device.  Devices that are on-campus, such as the computer lab and classroom computers, are updated each night.  With laptops, the updates are not necessarily installed as reliably so we ask that you check the status regularly. If your device has not been updated in a while, we will contact you by email and ask you to follow these steps.  In some cases, updates are not being received due to an issue with the device and we may need to have you contact the service desk to begin a remote troubleshooting session.</p>
<p>Be aware that once you begin the update process, any application that you have running will be closed in order to install updates.  Make sure you save your work before beginning the update and do not work on your computer while the update is running.</p>
<p>Your computer will restart once the update has completed.  It generally does not take more than half an hour to complete an update.</p>
