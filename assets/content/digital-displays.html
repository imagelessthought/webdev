<p>If you have an upcoming exhibition or event that requires an image slideshow, we provide a service that may meet your needs: we can create and host your slideshow on our webserver so that it is accessible using any web browser. All of the elements of the slideshow are <em>customizable</em>. You can choose the slide display durations and other design elements. Once we have worked with you to create your slide show we will send you a custom <b class="semi-bold">URL</b> that you can use on any digital display simply by opening a web browser to that page and putting the browser in <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/web-browser-fullscreen/" alt="Full Screen Mode Instructions" id="fsmode-text1">full screen mode</a>.  We can provide digital display and projectors for your exhibition or event: you can reserve the equipment you will need through our <a href="/checkout/" alt="Equipment Checkout" id="webcheckout">Equipment Checkout System</a>.</p>  
<p>This service does not currently support video in the slideshows but that is a feature planned for the Fall 2023.</p>
