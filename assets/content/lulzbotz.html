<h3>The tutorial below provides the step-by-step process to use the Lulzbot Taz 6 3D Printers:</h3>
<ol>
<li class="addpad">Open Cura from the Applications Folder.</li>
<li class="addpad">If Cura is not available in the Applications folder, it is available on Self Service.</li> 
<li class="addpad">If there are any other models on the build platform, select them and hit the delete key.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Check to make sure that the selected printer is the Lulzbot TAZ 6 Aerostruder.</li> 
<li class="addpad">You can either drag your file onto the platform or click the folder icon on the left side of the window to open your file.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Your model will appear on the build platform.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Depending on the model, it may appear in an awkward or unprintable orientation.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Models should be placed with the largest, flattest surface on the build platform. If this is not the case, select the model, and use the rotate tool to place the largest/flattest surface on the build plate.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Use the circles to rotate the model, and the “Lay Flat” button to force the model onto the build platform.</li> 
<li class="addpad">If your object has open spaces or overhangs, supports will likely be needed. Click the “Generate Supports” checkbox on the right side of the screen.</li> 
<li class="addpad">(Optional) To see how the supports will be constructed, click on the “Solid View” menu and change it to “Layer View”.</li> 
<li class="addpad">If you need to scale your model, mirror your model, or generate additional copies, you can perform these functions with the tools on the left side of the screen.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Each of these tools will either put different tools and/or bring up different menus to manipulate your model prior to printing.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Material Settings are in the right-hand control panel. The provided filament is easiest to find by making the following selections:</li>
<li class="addpad">From the Category Menu: select “Beginner”.</li> 
<li class="addpad">From the Material Menu: select “PLA (Village Plastics)".</li>
<li class="addpad">We recommend starting with “Standard” from the Profile Menu for most prints.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Infill is best left at 10% for most prints. Anything more than that will likely be no different functionally but will take much longer to print and use far more filament.</li>
<li class="addpad">For larger prints, try using “Gradual Infill.” This will dynamically adjust the infill closer to the external surfaces but leave a larger hollow space. This will dramatically speed up the print and save on filament.</li>
<li class="addpad"> Be sure that the skirt option is selected. The skirt functions to prime the print nozzle and will result in a better bottom layer.</li>
<li class="addpad">For smaller objects or objects with minimal build plate contact, raft can be used to ensure a better print.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Never choose “None".</li>
<li class="addpad">Before saving the print file, be sure to insert an SD card in the back of the computer.</li>
<li class="addpad">Please be careful when inserting the SD card into the slot. It must be inserted directly into the slot. Inserting the SD card at an angle may damage either the SD card or the built-in SD card reader.</li> 
<li class="addpad">SD cards are available for use with the 3D printers from the front desk.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Once there is an SD card in the computer, click “Save to Removable Drive”.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Note that if there is more than one “Removable Drive” plugged into the computer (SD Card, Flash Drive, portable hard drive, etc.), you must specify which device to save to.</li> 
<li class="addpad">A pop-up notice will appear stating that the file has been saved and that the drive may be ejected.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Do not use the Eject button on the pop-up notification.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Do not use the Eject button on the pop-up notification. Instead, close the notification with the “X” button and eject the disk by either dragging the disk to the trash or by right-clicking on it and selecting Eject.</li> 
<li class="addpad">Take the SD card to the lab attendant and they will be able to get your print started for you.</li>
