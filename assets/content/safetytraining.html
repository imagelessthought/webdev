<h2>Room Layout</h2>
<h3>Room 351 - Textiles</h3>
<p>The textiles area provides equipment for textiles processes such as sewing, knitting, and weaving. Equipment ranges from hand tools (knitting needles, table looms) to digitally assisted production (digital knitting machines, digital AVL loom). All of the equipment related to textiles involves the use of tension, and often weights. Understanding the mechanics and movements of the machines will help keep you and the equipment safe. </p>
<h4>Sewing Machines</h4>
<p>The Fabrication Lab offers a range of sewing machines and equipment. The Singer 4411/4452 are simple machines that can complete most jobs and are best for beginning sewing. The Juki DDL-5550 is a more industrial machine and is not recommended for beginners. Other specialty sewing machines are available upon request. A full equipment list is available in this section under the "Hardware, Machines and Tools" page. </p>
<p>Keep your hands a safe distance from the needle while sewing. </p>
<p>Properly store stray pins and needles. Bring a pin cushion or magnet to use while in the lab. </p>
<p>Do not sew over pins, which could lead to a projectile that could harm you, and/or the machine. </p>
<p>Turn off the machine before using your fingers near the needle. Turn off any machine when you are not using it. </p>
<p>If a needle breaks while using a machine, notify a technician. </p>
<p>Broken needles and sharps should be disposed of in the "SHARPS" container. </p>
<p>Only use the bobbins supplied with each machine. </p>
<h4>APQS Long Arm</h4>
<p>The APQS Long Arm Quilting Machine is an industrial style sewing machine that functions manually for free-form stitching, or automatically by translating digital vector files into stitched lines with a software called IntelliQuilter. The software can import .jpeg files or vectors in R12/LT2.dxf format. For more information about file prep and exporting, see “File Prep for IntelliQuilter” on the Fabrication Lab Canvas page. </p>
<p>When using the automated stitch system, make sure that the area is clear of objects and people that could be in the way of the moving machine head. Automated jobs must be supervised at all times; don't walk away from the machine while it's running. If a needle breaks or the threading comes undone, notify a technician. </p>
<h4>Knitting Machines</h4>
<p>The flat bed knitting machines use a long bed of knitting needles to quickly produce a row of knitted stitches. Be aware that the hooks are sharp and can easily snag fingers, hair, or loose clothing. Tie back hair and avoid loose clothing while working with these machines. The yarn is threaded through a system of loops to keep the tension while knitting. The auto-tension wires at the top of the machine can spring up suddenly if the yarn is loosened, so make sure to secure ends. </p>
<h4>Looms</h4>
<p>The Fabrication Lab has a few different types of looms: digital AVL loom, 4-harness table loom, 8-harness table loom, 4-harness folding loom, and Inkle loom. The looms use a system of moving mechanical parts to hold thread under tension for weaving. For this reason, it is important to be aware of components that hold weights and could move suddenly if released. Work with a lab tech to change any settings on the looms. We recommend conducting research on your own for projects involving weaving in our Literary Resource Library in the lab, and on the Fabrication Lab Canvas page. </p>
<h4>Rug Tufter</h4>
<p>The electronic rug tufter uses a motorized needle to quickly sew yarn through a mesh-like fabric. We have two machines with different pile capabilities: cut pile and loop pile. The fabric for tufting must be loosely woven. The lab provides tufting cloth, while supplies last. For information about vendors and supplies, visit the Fabrication Lab Canvas page.</p>
<p>These machines can be potentially harmful. The trigger button, which engages the needle, is very sensitive. Keep hands clear of the needle while handling the tufter and turn off the machine completely before threading or changing threads. We use a wooden frame with carpet tacking to stretch the tufting fabric. We have work gloves available to be worn during use to avoid cutting hands. </p>
<h4>Mutoh VJ-1938TX Textile Printer </h4>
<p>The printer uses fiber reactive dyes that work best on pre-treated natural fibers (cotton, linen, silk, viscose, and wool). The lab provides pre-treated 24” wide cotton fabric while supplies last. Files can be printed from .jpeg, .tiff, or .pdf at a quality of 180 dpi or higher for best results. Bring files on a USB or thumb drive. The fiber reactive dyes are treated as hazardous waste and collected in a plastic carboy for proper disposal. Wear gloves when interacting directly with the dyes. </p>
<h4>Roland Vinyl Cutter</h4>
<p>The vinyl cutter works by moving a tiny blade across the surface of the material. There are no fumes produced, no waste that needs special handling, and the only reason to wear gloves is to keep your fingerprints off the glossy sheets. A user is much more likely to damage the machine than the machine is to injure the user. </p>
<h3>Room 351A - 3D Printing and Lasers (Clean Room)</h3>
<p>The processes that take place in this room are relatively clean, especially when compared to room 369. There isn’t any sawdust being produced, and you won’t encounter any caustic or poisonous chemicals. The biggest threat to health and safety comes from the light being emitted from the lasers, and the fumes that are created during the burning of the material. </p>
<h4>Form Labs: Resin Printers</h4>
<p>The resin printers are classified as Class 1 lasers (same as simple everyday laser pointers) and have the lowest risk factor. The lasers will not fire with the lid open, so they are safe to use without protective eyewear. Any hazards are to be found in the resins that are used to make the prints and the Isopropyl alcohol used to wash them. Protective measures have been implemented to make this process as safe as possible. </p>
<p>When a part is finished printing, it must be submerged in a bath of Isopropyl alcohol. Nitrile gloves are provided to prevent skin irritation when handling prints. Wear them. Safety Data Sheets are available online for all materials if you are concerned about levels of exposure. Once the print is thoroughly cleaned and completely dry, ask a technician for assistance curing your print with the FORM CURE. The temperature and duration of cure is variable depending on the resin; a technician can help you determine this. </p>
<p>Note that you are responsible for cleaning up after yourself. Any tools used must be wiped down, any spills must be cleaned up. Paper towels contaminated with resin or alcohol are to be placed in the red flammable can. Trimmed supports must be swept up and disposed of. Leaving messes in this area is a health hazard and will lead to immediate loss of privileges. </p>
<h4>Laser Cutters</h4>
<p>All laser cutters are Class 4 lasers which means that they have an output power of 500 milliwatts and above. Our machines are equipped with safety interlocks and beam stops that prevent the laser from firing while the case is open. Additionally, the units are heavily shielded, so the chances of exposure are extremely low. However, one should still be sure to avoid any eye or skin contact with the beam and be aware that there is scattered radiation when using it. To prevent any retina damage, we provide orange-tinted glasses. Please note that regular sunglasses will NOT protect your eyes from the lasers. </p>
<p>Regardless of the materials chosen, the utilization of the laser cutters will always produce fumes. To reduce leakage and minimize exposure, ducts have been installed on each machine to carry the smoke out of the room. Prior to starting your job, it is critical that you open the right duct. There is a bank of green buttons on the north wall. Press the button to turn on the light and activate the gate. If the machine begins to smoke profusely when you start your job, stop it immediately and check your settings. Chances are you forgot to activate the gate. Do not open the lid of the machine until the smoke has been filtered out by the exhaust. </p>
<p>Note that there is also the potential of materials catching fire if the laser is operating on the wrong settings. To prevent this, make sure to check with a Lab Tech to see if you have entered in the correct setting prior to starting a job. In the situation of a fire occurring, make sure to immediately stop the machine and inform a lab tech. Emergency stop buttons are located on the front of each machine. Do not be afraid to use them. </p>
<p>The greatest danger associated with these machines lies in the material that you are working with. Many substrates can give off harmful gases when exposed to heat. Some give off noxious chlorine or arsenic fumes that can cause lung or neurological damage. When uncertain about a material, you can look up its Safety Data Sheet (SDS) online. SDS’s also include information such as physical data (melting point, boiling point, flash point, etc.), toxicity, health effects, first aid, reactivity, storage, disposal, protective equipment, and spill/leak procedures. Always get the approval of a Lab Tech before using anything unfamiliar. </p>

<h3>Room 369 - CNC Room (Dirty Room)</h3>
<p>Room 369 produces excess amounts of debris while operating these machines. It also contains the most potentially dangerous equipment in the entire lab. For respiratory safety, dust collection and air filtration are installed at each station to deal with the majority of the particulates, but it isn’t 100 percent effective. Students are required to wear ear and eye protection during all operations and N95 dust masks are available upon request. While this is true for everything residing in 369, each piece of equipment has its own additional considerations. The equipment in this room takes a significant amount of time to set up, we recommend at least 1-hour reservations to accommodate set up time and length of job. </p>
<h4>CNC Routers</h4>
<p>The CNC router is primarily used on wood, plastic, and occasionally aluminum. The operation requires using a sharpened bit, which closely resembles a drill bit, but can cut in more directions than just straight down. The bit is clamped in with a collet to a spindle which rotates at a high rate of speed, usually between 12,000 and 18,000 revolutions per minute. The spindle itself is mounted on a motorized gantry that follows a user-programmed path. There are many ways a CNC job can go wrong, and it is essential you minimize the risk as much as possible. </p>
<p>Be sure to adhere material to the bed (i.e. screw, hot glue, etc.) and be aware of your tool path to avoid hitting any screws in the material. If this happens, it’s possible to shear the screw right off, but more likely the bit will break and go flying. Once the job is running, stay a safe distance from the machine. Keep hands off the rails to avoid getting fingers crushed. Keep hair tied back and avoid loose clothing so nothing gets yanked into the spindle. If the machine malfunctions or acts in an unexpected manner, do not hesitate to use the emergency stop. Notify a Lab Tech immediately. </p>
<h4>Plasma Cutter</h4>
<p>Plasma cutters are typically reserved for steel but can sometimes accommodate copper and brass. We recommend buying material that is no larger than 4’ x 4’ because of the plasma bed size. The plasma cutter functions by directing a stream of electrically charged particles (plasma) with a jet of compressed air. Plasma is a special state of matter that is found in only two places in nature: the surface of the sun and inside of lightning bolts. It can liquefy steel in an instant, so it must be treated with respect. Like the router, the plasma torch is mounted on a programmable gantry. The bed of this machine is comprised of steel slats submerged in water. This can be a problematic arrangement, with plenty of opportunity for injury. Welding gear is required when working with this machine (fire retardant jacket, shaded face shield or glasses, gloves, etc.). The machine sparks within a 3 ft perimeter around it, so make sure to keep a safe distance. The only exception is if you are cutting into copper, you will need to stand close by with a hose to cool down the surface. To prevent any passersby from being blinded, you will need to enclose the space with the gray curtains. </p>
<p>When starting a job, make sure to turn on the fume extractor. This will scrub any noxious vapors out of the air. Don’t cut anything galvanized or zinc-coated because it will emit sulfuric gas. If sulfuric gas is emitted, you will notice a white/yellow powder forming around the edges of the cuts. </p>
<p>Please note that your material will be extremely hot right after processing a job. We provide rubber gloves if your metal cuts fall into the waterbed. It is suggested that you have your tetanus shot updated because of the excess amounts of rust in the waterbed. </p>
<h4>Wazer</h4>
<p>A desktop waterjet cutter. The machine operates using high powered water and an abrasive to cut material. We use a Wazer approved garnet abrasive. The cutting area is 12” x 18”. The Wazer can cut a variety of materials including aluminum, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, marble, and carbon fiber. For more information, see the Wazer Materials webpage. </p>
<p>If you are within 10 feet of the Wazer, you should wear safety glasses and non-slip shoes, whether you are the operator. If you are in the CNC room while the Wazer is in operation, you must wear hearing protection. Always wear gloves to handle material. Never touch any components inside the machine while the Wazer is operating. Please make sure the lid is closed for operation. Disconnect Wazer from power and shut off the water when not in use. All operators should note the Power Switch, On/Off Valve, and Water Shutoff location. Never walk away from your job on the Wazer or any machine in the Fabrication Lab. </p>
